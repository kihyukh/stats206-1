Title : Datasets and case studies
---

A major part of this course involves analysis of datasets drawn from
various fields.  We have created a repository of datasets, and developed
case studies relating to these datasets.  These case studies are all in
the form of Jupyter notebooks that you will run on the Greatlakes
system.  The data are stored on Greatlakes and are ready to be accessed.

Below is a list of the datasets, and the case studies for each
dataset.  We also provide a brief description of the learning goals
for each case study.

* _Austin emobility_: This is an extract from a log of all e-scooter
rentals in Austin, Texas for a period from April, 2018 to July, 2020.
The 'scooters_basic.ipynb' notebook illustrates how to load and
manipulate data, work with dates and times, pivot dataframes,
and produce basic statistical summaries including proportions and quantiles.

* _American Community Survey_: This survey, known as the ACS, is the
premier survey of the US population.  The 'acs_basic.ipynb' notebook
looks at summary statistics of ACS variables to illustrate statistical
concepts such as location, dispersion and skew, quantiles, moments,
grouping/aggregation, and some basic plotting.

* _Global Historical Climatology Network_: This is a highly curated
collection of weather data from stations around the world.  The
'ghcn_scatterplot.ipynb' notebook focuses on using plotting and
scatterplot smoothing to explore relationships among quantitative
variables in the dataset.

* _National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey_: This is a
high-quality survey of US adults focusing on aspects of health and
nutrition.  The 'nhanes_sampling.ipynb' notebook focuses on using the
NHANES data to understand sampling properties of the mean and other
statistics, and the Central Limit Theorem.

* _World Health Organization mortality_: This is a dataset compiled by
the World Health Organization (WHO) that reports sex and
cause-specific mortality by country and by year.  The
'who_mortality.ipynb' notebook uses this data to illustrate methods
for statistically comparing proportions (mortality rates) between
groups using standard errors and Z-scores.

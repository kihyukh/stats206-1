title : Relationship to other courses
---

This course covers about 80% of the topics covered in Statistics 250,
and adds some additional topics that are not covered in 250.  Stat 206
and 250 are both introductory courses, and are similar in terms of
workload and difficulty.  Most students should only take one of these
two courses.  Statistics 206 can replace Statistics 250 in any program
offered through the Department of Statistics, including the Statistics
major and minors, the Data Science major, and the Informatics major.
If you wish to use Statistics 206 to satisfy a requirement for any
other major or minor, you should check with advisors in the relevant
department to be sure that this course qualifies.

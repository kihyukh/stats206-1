Title : About this course
---

In this course, you will learn to pose interesting questions and draw
meaningful conclusions from data.  It is an introductory statistics
course, with a focus on data analysis.  We will also cover the basic
theory behind the methods that we use in the course.  Much of the
course will focus on analyzing datasets drawn from a number of
different fields.  We will discuss case studies using these datasets,
and you will conduct your own analyses.

In this course you will learn to do data analysis using the
[Python](https://python.org) programming language.  Specifically, you
will learn to use a few Python libraries that support data analysis,
especially [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org).  You do not need to
have prior experience with computer programming, or with Python.  This
is not a programming class, and we will only cover the programming
topics that we need in order to accomplish our data analysis goals.
You will gain some proficiency in Python, but this course will not
give you a systematic and thorough introduction to Python or to
computer science.  Instead, the main goal of the course is to
introduce you to the conceptual and practical aspects of rigorous data
analysis.
